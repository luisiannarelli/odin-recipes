    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cooking sherry</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>       
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Form into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties and onion in the oil until patties are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle flour over the onions and drippings in the skillet. Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom as you stir. Gradually mix in the beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until the gravy thickens. Turn heat to low, return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer for another 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
